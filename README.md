# Data-Governance
_What is meant by governance?_
- Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee thhe control and direction of an area of interest.
- It ensures how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
- Formal governance becomes important in such sense that entities grow and increase in complexity.
- When left ungoverned, chaos might strike.
- The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
- Eg, given their goals as organizations, governance is from public angency is greatly different from private enterprise.
- Each entities have different purposes and responsibilities.
- Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results(like meeting goals or sustaining standards)can be attained.

_What is data governance?_
- Data governance is all about managing data well, but it isn't restricted to only data management.
- When data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise's most abudant and important lever for success.
- Data that is well-managed can be transformational, and can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture.
- When decision at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner, better outcomes internally and to customers are yet delivered.
- Data risks can be minimized when data governance is successful, thus data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
- Every organization manages data at some level, that being said, all businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations.
- However, there is a difference between businesses managing and consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly.
- The difference is characterised by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.
- Enterprise information management (EIM) is a discipline that recognizes the value of an organization's information assets, focusing on effective data governance and technology use to elevate data into shared assets.

_Data Governance vs Data Management:_
- Data governance and data management are often confused in the EIM space, with data governance focusing on roles, policies, and data lifecycle, while data management involves technical implementation of data governance through databases, data warehouses, and analytics software.

_Data Governance vs Informatio Governance:_
- In EIM, data governance and information governance are often confused.
- Data governance focuses on data, while information governance focuses on its meaning and its relationship with outcomes and value.
- Data governance practitioners may operate in both worlds daily, but understanding the context of data and desired business outcomes can complement data governance efforts effectively.

_The value of Data Governance:_
- Data governance is a crucial aspect of an organization's success, as 91% of business leaders believe it is a critical part of their success.
- It involves processes and policies to leverage data's value and reduce risks.
- Good data governance leads to improved data quality, expanded value, increased compliance, better data-driven decision-making, enhanced business performance, greater data sharing, increased availability, improved data search, reduced risks, and reduced data management costs.
- Without formalized data governance, organizations may struggle to achieve these advantages and may suffer negative consequences, such as poor-quality data.

_Creating a Data Governance Program:_
- Data governance is a crucial aspect of managing and delivering data to an organization.
- It involves:
        1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
        2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
        3. Developing a proposal.
        4. Gaining leadership approval.
        5. Designing and developing the program.
        6. Implementing the proram.
        7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
        8. Maintaining the program.
- The approach to data governance varies depending on the business's sophistication and nature.
- Data governance is achieved through a set of common elements, including actions taken by team members, policies and processes followed, and the use of technologies throughout the data lifecycle.
- As a discipline, data governance is becoming increasingly important for many organizations.

_Developing a Data Governance Framework:_
- Data governance programs cannot be purchased off the shelf, but organizations must implement them based on their level of interest, needs, budget, and capabilities.
- A modest effort can yield meaningful results. The data governance framework, a set of guiding concepts and structure, is essential for implementing these elements.
- Different degrees of implementation can be pursued, and the course teaches you to decide what makes the most sense for your organization.
- The COBIT IT governance framework shares common components addressing people, processes, and technology.

_Leadership and Strategy:_
- Data governance programs must align with the organization's strategy, ensuring a clear alignment between data's role in risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies.
- A disconnect between business goals and data governance is the main reason for failure.
- To ensure success, senior leadership must support and agree on mapping organizational strategy to data governance, as without their support, data governance efforts will fail.

_Roles and Responsibilities:_
- Data governance programs require the right people at the right time, with specific roles and responsibilities assigned from IT teams to data stewards.
- However, understanding that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone is crucial.

_Policies, Processes, and Standards:_
- Data governance programs rely on policies, processes, and standards to guide responsibilities and maintain uniformity across the organization.
- These must be designed, developed, and deployed, requiring significant effort depending on the size and complexity of the organization.

_Metrics:_
- The data governance program should have a mechanism to measure its performance, capturing metrics and delivering them to stakeholders for support and funding.
- This allows for continuous improvements or radical changes to ensure the program is producing value and delivering expected results.

_Tools:_
- A vast marketplace exists for data governance and management tools, including master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
- These tools have democratized data management, empowering more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

_Communications and Collaboration:_
- Data governance requires high-quality communication, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
- Change management is crucial to ensure impacted team members understand the changes.
- Collaboration among diverse stakeholders is essential for effective data governance.
- A positive culture, clear channels, and online platforms are essential for success.
- Regular meetings and online platforms are increasingly used for effective communication.

_Preparing the Data Governance:_
- Data governance is not a simple process of forming a team, creating a plan, and purchasing tools.
- It requires careful treatment, starting with understanding an organization's readiness to accept it.
- This involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists, as an immature, reactive culture is different from a sophisticated data-driven culture.
- Additionally, ensuring the organization's strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program is crucial for success.
- A checklist can help evaluate an organization's readiness for a data governance program.

_What is data culture?_
- Many well-designed projects fail due to unprepared environments or inadequate conditions for success.
- A study by IDC found that 70% of organizations failing due to lack of a prerequisite data culture to support technological upgrades.
- Culture will always defeat the greatest strategies, and every organization has some form of a data culture, but it might not be in an ideal state.
- Therefore, organizations should focus on developing a strong data culture to ensure successful implementation.

_Assessing the Data Culture:_
- To increase your chances of success, it is essential to understand your organization's data culture and how it values and manages data.
- A mature data culture is characterized by a focus on data as a central aspect of operations and decision-making.
- Effective data cultures empower all employees, from interns to CEOs, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work.
- These cultures ensure employees have the skills to use data analytics and make data-driven decisions.
- In a data culture, decisions are based on data and insights, rather than gut feelings or opinions.
- To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional, and data culture is now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
- Leaders recognize the importance of leveraging data and the actions taken by senior leaders to foster its use.
- Trust is also crucial for team members to make data-driven decisions.
- To assess the maturity of your organization's data culture, interview leaders and team members, observe decision-making processes, communication, and data governance.
- If your data culture is sufficient for a data governance program, you are in good shape.
- Implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture.
