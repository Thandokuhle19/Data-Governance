<summary> Charpter 1 : Defining Data Governance </summary>
<br>
 
_What is meant by governance?_
- Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee thhe control and direction of an area of interest.
- It ensures how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced.
- Formal governance becomes important in such sense that entities grow and increase in complexity.
- When left ungoverned, chaos might strike.
- The formality and structure that governance takes depend on context and intent.
- Eg, given their goals as organizations, governance is from public angency is greatly different from private enterprise.
- Each entities have different purposes and responsibilities.
- Governance is the system that formalizes control, processes, and accountabilities so that specific results(like meeting goals or sustaining standards)can be attained.

_What is data governance?_
- Data governance is all about managing data well, but it isn't restricted to only data management.
- When data is managed well, it can drive innovation and growth and can be an enterprise's most abudant and important lever for success.
- Data that is well-managed can be transformational, and can support the desirable qualities of a data-driven culture.
- When decision at all levels of the organization are made using data in an informed and structured manner, better outcomes internally and to customers are yet delivered.
- Data risks can be minimized when data governance is successful, thus data compliance and regulatory requirements can be met with ease.
- Every organization manages data at some level, that being said, all businesses generate, process, use, and store data as a result of their daily operations.
- However, there is a difference between businesses managing and consider data to be a valuable asset and treat it accordingly.
- The difference is characterised by the degree to which there are formalities in managing data.
- Enterprise information management (EIM) is a discipline that recognizes the value of an organization's information assets, focusing on effective data governance and technology use to elevate data into shared assets.

_Data Governance vs Data Management:_
- Data governance and data management are often confused in the EIM space, with data governance focusing on roles, policies, and data lifecycle, while data management involves technical implementation of data governance through databases, data warehouses, and analytics software.

_Data Governance vs Informatio Governance:_
- In EIM, data governance and information governance are often confused.
- Data governance focuses on data, while information governance focuses on its meaning and its relationship with outcomes and value.
- Data governance practitioners may operate in both worlds daily, but understanding the context of data and desired business outcomes can complement data governance efforts effectively.

_The value of Data Governance:_
- Data governance is a crucial aspect of an organization's success, as 91% of business leaders believe it is a critical part of their success.
- It involves processes and policies to leverage data's value and reduce risks.
- Good data governance leads to improved data quality, expanded value, increased compliance, better data-driven decision-making, enhanced business performance, greater data sharing, increased availability, improved data search, reduced risks, and reduced data management costs.
- Without formalized data governance, organizations may struggle to achieve these advantages and may suffer negative consequences, such as poor-quality data.

_Creating a Data Governance Program:_
- Data governance is a crucial aspect of managing and delivering data to an organization.
- It involves:
        1. Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
        2. Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
        3. Developing a proposal.
        4. Gaining leadership approval.
        5. Designing and developing the program.
        6. Implementing the proram.
        7. Monitoring and measuring performance.
        8. Maintaining the program.
- The approach to data governance varies depending on the business's sophistication and nature.
- Data governance is achieved through a set of common elements, including actions taken by team members, policies and processes followed, and the use of technologies throughout the data lifecycle.
- As a discipline, data governance is becoming increasingly important for many organizations.

_Developing a Data Governance Framework:_
- Data governance programs cannot be purchased off the shelf, but organizations must implement them based on their level of interest, needs, budget, and capabilities.
- A modest effort can yield meaningful results. The data governance framework, a set of guiding concepts and structure, is essential for implementing these elements.
- Different degrees of implementation can be pursued, and the course teaches you to decide what makes the most sense for your organization.
- The COBIT IT governance framework shares common components addressing people, processes, and technology.

_Leadership and Strategy:_
- Data governance programs must align with the organization's strategy, ensuring a clear alignment between data's role in risk management, innovation, and operational efficiencies.
- A disconnect between business goals and data governance is the main reason for failure.
- To ensure success, senior leadership must support and agree on mapping organizational strategy to data governance, as without their support, data governance efforts will fail.

_Roles and Responsibilities:_
- Data governance programs require the right people at the right time, with specific roles and responsibilities assigned from IT teams to data stewards.
- However, understanding that data governance requires responsibilities from nearly everyone is crucial.

_Policies, Processes, and Standards:_
- Data governance programs rely on policies, processes, and standards to guide responsibilities and maintain uniformity across the organization.
- These must be designed, developed, and deployed, requiring significant effort depending on the size and complexity of the organization.

_Metrics:_
- The data governance program should have a mechanism to measure its performance, capturing metrics and delivering them to stakeholders for support and funding.
- This allows for continuous improvements or radical changes to ensure the program is producing value and delivering expected results.

_Tools:_
- A vast marketplace exists for data governance and management tools, including master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance.
- These tools have democratized data management, empowering more team members to better manage and derive value from data.

_Communications and Collaboration:_
- Data governance requires high-quality communication, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops.
- Change management is crucial to ensure impacted team members understand the changes.
- Collaboration among diverse stakeholders is essential for effective data governance.
- A positive culture, clear channels, and online platforms are essential for success.
- Regular meetings and online platforms are increasingly used for effective communication.

_Preparing the Data Governance:_
- Data governance is not a simple process of forming a team, creating a plan, and purchasing tools.
- It requires careful treatment, starting with understanding an organization's readiness to accept it.
- This involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists, as an immature, reactive culture is different from a sophisticated data-driven culture.
- Additionally, ensuring the organization's strategy is fully aligned with the proposed program is crucial for success.
- A checklist can help evaluate an organization's readiness for a data governance program.

_What is data culture?_
- Many well-designed projects fail due to unprepared environments or inadequate conditions for success.
- A study by IDC found that 70% of organizations failing due to lack of a prerequisite data culture to support technological upgrades.
- Culture will always defeat the greatest strategies, and every organization has some form of a data culture, but it might not be in an ideal state.
- Therefore, organizations should focus on developing a strong data culture to ensure successful implementation.

_Assessing the Data Culture:_
- To increase your chances of success, it is essential to understand your organization's data culture and how it values and manages data.
- A mature data culture is characterized by a focus on data as a central aspect of operations and decision-making.
- Effective data cultures empower all employees, from interns to CEOs, to access and use meaningful and timely data for their work.
- These cultures ensure employees have the skills to use data analytics and make data-driven decisions.
- In a data culture, decisions are based on data and insights, rather than gut feelings or opinions.
- To be competitive, a progressive data-driven strategy is no longer optional, and data culture is now considered a new way of doing business in the digital age.
- Leaders recognize the importance of leveraging data and the actions taken by senior leaders to foster its use.
- Trust is also crucial for team members to make data-driven decisions.
- To assess the maturity of your organization's data culture, interview leaders and team members, observe decision-making processes, communication, and data governance.
- If your data culture is sufficient for a data governance program, you are in good shape.
- Implementing data governance will be a positive and important contributing factor to building a data culture.

_Maturing the Data Culture:_
- Data Governance Preparation Course
        • Help leaders communicate data value and prioritize it.
        • Provide basic tools and education for data use.
        • Highlight the capabilities of common applications like spreadsheets.
        • Show progress through small steps, not complex solutions.
        • Recognize resistance and frustration as part of the journey.
        • Provide comfort and rewards to team members.
        • Provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

_Assessing Data Governance Readiness:_
- Data Governance Program Design and Preparation
          • Identifying the readiness of an organization for a data governance program is crucial.
          • The program should align with business strategy, with senior leadership fully committed to its goals.
          • The program should be a strategic, enterprise initiative, not solely IT department-related.
          • Executive sponsors should be identified at the executive level.
          • The program should be funded and maintained long-term.
          • The program should be an ongoing project, not a one-off project.
          • Documentation of return-on-investment (ROI) is essential.
          • Legal and compliance teams should support the program's goals.
         • Fundamental data skills are necessary for the data governance journey.
         • The IT organization should be capable and resourced to support the program.

<summary> Charpter 2 : Exploring a World Overflowing with data </summary>
<br>

_Defining Data:_
- Data is a common and widely used tool in our daily lives, often taken for granted.
- However, when asked to define data, it may not be entirely accurate or even the same as colleagues' definitions.
- It's crucial to ensure everyone is on the same page about data's meaning, especially when discussing information, knowledge, and insights.
- It's even more important to understand data governance and management, as data governance is different from data management.
- A solid definition of data and its role today helps us align ourselves and deliver on the promise of data governance.
- It's essential to be on the same page and ensure everyone is on the same page about data.

_Why all the focus on data:_
- Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, such as words, numbers, and text, that represent something meaningful when processed.
- Data is often used in singular and plural contexts, and its meaning depends on its captured format. Data can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured, depending on its format.
- Structured data is formatted to fit into a table in a database, while unstructured data requires processing to be used.
- Semi-structured data contains additional information for native format analysis.
- Units of data are largely worthless until processed and applied.
- When combined with good governance, data can be useful in various functions, making it an important asset.
- To begin to have value, data requires effort.
- For example, putting the word "orange" in a sentence or converting the number 42 into information using structure and context gives the data meaning.
- This basic action of data processing is the core foundation of an industry that has ushered in rapid digital transformation.
- Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).

_Welcome to the Zettabyte Era:_
- A zettabyte is a large number, representing the volume of data created and stored in the 21st century.
- It is 1021 bytes, or a 1 with 21 zeros. By 2020, we had created 64 zettabytes of data, and this number is projected to reach over 100 zettabytes by 2023.
- The datasphere, which describes all data created, is projected to double in 3-4 years.
- Each byte is made up of eight bits, which are binary and represent characters that humans can understand.
- As data volume continues to grow, other terms will be used to describe even bigger volumes, such as Yottabyte and Brontobyte eras.
- Effective data management is crucial in this rapidly expanding data volume, as managing small amounts of data can be challenging.

_From Data to Insight:_
- Data collection and storage should be done with a clear purpose and intent to be used in the future.
- Data that is never used is less useful than producing reports. Knowledge, when applied to context, becomes actionable and can be applied to wisdom.
- Wisdom helps determine the contextual validity of knowledge and can lead to deeper understanding.
- Insight, a combination of knowledge and wisdom, is the ultimate destination derived from data, allowing for a deeper understanding and different perspectives.

_The Role of Data in the 21st Century:_
- Data has played a crucial role in understanding the world, making informed decisions, and solving problems since the 19th and 20th centuries.
- However, the role of data has grown since the mid-20th century with the rise of computer systems.
- The quality and availability of data have increased, leading to the motto "Putting information at your fingertips."
- In the early 21st century, the amount of data produced is beyond our capacity, reshaping industries, cities, and our learning, socializing, and entertainment methods.
- This has also raised risks, with cyberattacks causing millions of dollars in losses.

_Data-Driven Decision-Making:_
- Data is valuable for making better decisions, such as reading customer reviews on websites like Hello Peter or Google Reviews.
- It can motivate actions and make decisions easier.
- However, data-driven decision-making is less complex and requires deep understanding of the data.
- In the 21st century, abundant good-quality data has been beneficial for decision-making, but bad data can lead to costly mistakes.
- Data governance plays a central role in achieving data quality, as it is the product of deliberate actions.

_Data as The New Oil:_
- Data, like oil, has the potential to drive and grow economies, but it requires processing and organization to be useful.
- Like oil, data must be refined to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.
- Data is now powering the digital economies of the 21st century, with big economic powerhouses like Facebook and Google dominating.
- However, data management is moving from a cost center to a profit center, generating new revenue sources.

_Data Ownership:_
- Accountability is crucial for proper management and is incorporated into job descriptions and projects.
- It is essential to have accountability for every data set in an organization, which includes rights ranging from lightweight oversight to legally enforceable rules.
- For instance, intellectual property data has high protection levels.
- Data ownership refers to the rights an individual, team, or organization holds over data sets, ranging from minimal oversight to legally enforceable rules, particularly in cases of intellectual property.

_Data Architecture:_
- Most organizations are technology businesses, and enterprise architecture (EA) is a practice that helps organizations design and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support their business goals.
- Data architecture is a subset of EA, which aligns data design and management decisions with EA and the business.
- High-quality enterprises and data architectures help organizations run smoothly and transform as conditions dictate.
- Data architecture supports data availability, complexity, protection, standards, and efficient use.
- It is a reflection of data governance and is a cross-organizational responsibility, as data must flow across business silos and serve multiple audiences.
- Data architecture ensures data availability, simplifies access, enforces protections, adopts data standards, and optimizes data flow to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication, supporting organizational policies and obligations.

_The Lifecycle of Data:_
- Data Lifecycle Overview
       • Creation: Data creation, either manual or automated, occurs through various activities        
                   including system inputs and outputs.
       • Storage: Data is stored in a database, which can be a local hard drive, server, or cloud     
                  service.
       • Usage: Data is captured and stored for future use, possibly for analysis. It may need  
                processing, including cleansing, transforming, and securing access rights.
       • Archival: Data is moved to a long-term storage system for future retrieval and utilization.
       • Destruction: Data is made inaccessible and unreadable, including physical destruction of  
                      devices.
- Data governance considers data being in different states at different times, with unique requirements depending on the stage of its life.

_Understandig the Impact of Big Data:_
- Data has been a part of human history, dating back to ancient Roman ledgers.
- The Cold War and space race accelerated technological advancements, leading to microprocessors and classical computing, as well as telecommunications innovation.

_The Role of the U.S. Census in the Information Revolution:_
- Data processing has been around since the late 1800s, with the first company to automate and commercialize it being the Tabulating Machine Company.
- This company converted handwritten census results into punched holes in cards, which were later renamed IBM.
- Over the years, IBM and its data processing cohorts expanded automation in various aspects of life, leading to the information age.
- Data became the raw material for productivity and ideas, and connectivity allowed information to flow freely across devices, organizations, and geographies.
- By the turn of the century, data creation, storage, and use exploded, creating a data swamp that was difficult for traditional software applications to manage.

_Defining Big Data:_
- Big data is massive, complex data that requires new tools, skills, and processes.
- One way to define and characterise big data is through these five:
        • Volume: Unprecedented scale of data necessitates new tools, skills, and processes.
        • Variety: Existing legacy file formats and new innovations necessitate different handling   
                   methods.
        • Velocity: Rapid data creation and movement due to numerous collection points and digital     
                    interfaces.
        • Variability: Unpredictability in data creation and flow.
        • Veracity: Variability in the quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volumes   
                    of disparate data sets, posing challenges to data management.

_Drivers of Big Data:_
- In 2003, Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of Google, stated that every two days, the world was creating more data than all data created since the dawn of civilization.
- By the third decade of the 21st century, the volume of data created had experienced a Cambrian explosion, reaching zettabytes.
- In 2021, global technology use generated 79 zettabytes of data, with an anticipated 180 zettabytes in 2025.

_Consequences of Big Data:_
- Big data statistics are impressive, but they don't fully reveal the full picture.
- Up to 80% of data is unstructured, which many organizations struggle with.
- Additionally, a lot of this data is duplicative, bad data, or has errors.
- Despite these challenges, big data is providing value to organizations and fostering innovation, such as self-driving cars and optimized supply chains.
- The combination of hyperconnectivity and data allows marketers to understand the marketplace in detail, targeting specific audiences and individuals where the chance of a sale is highest.

_What about small data?:_
- Big data is crucial for digital economy business activities, but small data sets like spreadsheets, surveys, and lists are also valuable.
- Big data can be broken down into smaller, manageable chunks, making it more meaningful and useful in decision-making and day-to-day operations.
- Small data can be the only way to make sense of big data.

_Enter the Realm of Smart Data:_
- Smart data refers to big data that is optimized for specific uses, delivering the highest business value.
- It uses new processes and tools, such as artificial intelligence, to find patterns in unstructured data and extract relevant data for specific applications.
- This approach reduces time, lowers errors, and enables the creation of new data subsets.
- Data governance is concerned with data in any form, ensuring its value is maximized.

_Identifying the Roles of Data:_
- Data is crucial for organizations, encompassing daily use across all business functions.
- It's essential to ensure it's high-quality, secure, compliant, and accessible to the right people.
- It's not just for data analytics or IT, but also decision-makers and leaders.

_Operations:_
- Business operations encompass a range of activities to manage an organization's daily needs and drive its mission.
- Core functions like payroll, order management, and marketing are common in almost every organization.
- However, not all organizations require IT or warehouse support.
- Operations are powered by various data and information sources, and they also generate a lot of data.
- The performance of operations can be easily quantified by data, such as in human resources (HR) functions where data is created by the activities of the function.
- Operations use data to make decisions, enable systems to run, and deliver data to internal and external entities.
- Support operations often use automated data functions, such as warehouse inventory systems that automatically generate replenishment orders when stock levels drop.
- Notifications generated by systems based on triggers can help identify who hasn't submitted their time and expense report.
- Overall, data plays a crucial role in business operations.
- Most data scenarios involve skilled personnel, dedicated processes, and various technologies that are partially or entirely focused on handling operational data.

_Strategy:_
- Organizations have a strategy, which involves creating a plan to support objectives and goals.
- It involves understanding challenges and agreeing on solutions. Strategy and operations are interconnected, with data-driven strategies delivering operational excellence being a winning ticket.
- The process begins with an analysis of the environment, conclusions, and a plan driven by guiding principles.
- The availability of good quality data is crucial for processing and analyzing insights.
- The right mix of data and non-data sources is essential for delivering expected results.
- Strategy development should be an ongoing process, revisiting it every six months and tweaking as necessary.
- In the 21st century, organizations need to react quickly to environmental conditions, and data will form the backbone of their response system.

_Decision-Making:_
- Data-driven decision-making is a crucial business competency, but it requires access to quality data at the right time.
- With the vast volume and quality of data available today, it allows for better-informed decisions.
- However, bad data can lead to failure, ranging from minor mistakes to job termination or even business closure.
- Popular search engines like Google and Bing have transformed how we make decisions, but also have pitfalls.
- Data-driven decision-making relies on access to quality data at the right time, and bad data can result in failure.

_Measuring:_
- Organizations continuously measure data to build a picture of their business.
- Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative, with quantitative data often described in numerical terms and qualitative data described in terms of language.
- The type of information desired directly correlates with the measurement approach, which informs the choices of what, when, where, and how data is captured.
- A general rule is to capture and measure what matters, but be cautious with limited resources and potential costs.
- William Bruce Cameron's quote "Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted" emphasizes that not everything that can be counted counts.

_Monitoring:_
- Monitoring is an ongoing process of collecting and evaluating the performance of a project, process, system, or other item of interest.
- It helps ensure the continuity, stability, and reliability of the supervised activities.
- Monitoring involves the data produced by the thing being evaluated and the data produced as a product of monitoring.
- This data feeds reports, real-time systems, and software-based dashboards, and can guide decisions.
- The role of data in measurement and monitoring often go hand-in-hand, as data is a connective tissue that binds business functions.
- This interdependence requires oversight and controls, as stakeholders often have different responsibilities and permissions.
- Data monitoring also evaluates the quality of data, determining if it is fit for purpose.
- By continuously monitoring the quality of data, opportunities and issues can be revealed in a timely manner, allowing for appropriate actions to be prioritized.

_Insight Management:_
- Data is crucial for business functions and decision-making, providing valuable information that can make a difference.
- However, it requires a management process to ensure data and information are capable of delivering insights.
- Insight management involves gathering and analyzing data from various sources, understanding the organization's information needs, and interpreting the data's implications.
- Effective communication of findings is essential for aligning with organizational goals.
- The right information, at the right time, in the right format, and for the right people is crucial for valuable insights.
- Knowledge management supports organizational support structures and tools for enabling insight availability.

_Reporting:_
- Reports are a crucial aspect of data and information management in any organization.
- They are essential for creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on data, making them the backbone of every business.
- Reports contain structured data and information, such as expenditure reports, which provide a basic overview and relevant information.
- Visuals, such as charts, are popular for presenting data and facilitating interpretation.
- Reports can be online or physical, and can be given verbally, in person, or via video.
- The purpose of reporting is largely to improve decision-making, empower business leaders, and communicate plans and policies.
- However, knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time.

_Other Roles for Data:_
- Data is essential in various aspects of organizations, including artificial intelligence (AI), problem-solving, and data reuse.
- AI relies on data for learning patterns, identifying relationships, and determining probabilities.
- Problem-solving involves defining problems, determining available solutions, evaluating them, and measuring their success.
- Data reuse can reduce data collection duplication and increase the value of data to an organization. However, it must be managed carefully to avoid breaking data use rules. High-value shared data sets, called master data, are subject to master data management in data governance.

_Imporving Outcomes with Data:_
- Now we have identified and discussed the diverse roles, it's important to understand how data can be leveraged to its maximum value.
- It starts with identifying that data is an organizational asset meaning it brings economic value to the organization.
- Data gets differently when it is considered to be high-value.
- The function that is mainly associated with data is the process of exploring it and looking for insights.

_Approaching Data as an Asset:_
- Asset: something owned by a person, an organization, or governemnt with the expection of bringing economic benegit.
- This includes the generation of income, the reduction of expenses, or an increase in net worth.
